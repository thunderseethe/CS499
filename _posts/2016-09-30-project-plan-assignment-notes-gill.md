This post refers to the Project Plan Assignment, due on September 20th.
During the course of these assignments, communication between the team was conducted primarily over Telegram, an instant messaging application. This allowed our team to work on the assignments at different times and maintain clear communication of responsibilities.

We decided to split up the Project Plan document as follows:

- Ethan Gill (me): Title Page, Table of Contents, Nonfunctional Requirements, Part of Metrics Document, Development and Target Environments
- Matthew Turner: Introduction, Project Overview, System Model, Conclusion
- Arthur Silveira: Project Plan Document, Part of Metrics Document
- Ethan Smith: Functional Requirements, Setup of Project Website, Feasibility

After the rough draft of the assignment, I proofread and corrected grammatical errors in the entire writeup.
The word breakdown for this assignment is as follows:

- Ethan Gill: 1380 words
- Arthur Silveira: 1380 words
- Ethan Smith: 1400 words (including website setup)
- Matthew Turner: 1380 words
