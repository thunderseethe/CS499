This post refers to the Architecture Assignment, due on October 3rd. It also includes information about the associated presentation assignment.
During the course of these assignments, communication between the team was conducted primarily over Telegram, an instant messaging application. This allowed our team to work on the assignments at different times and maintain clear communication of responsibilities.

We decided to split up the Architecture document as follows:

- Ethan Gill (me): Testing Section, Title Page, Table of Contents
- Matthew Turner: Architecture Diagram
- Arthur Silveira: Quality Assurance and Metrics
- Ethan Smith: Detailed Diagrams

The testing section consists of 1217 words. Additionally, the Title Page and Table of Contents consist of 76 words. Thus, I wrote 1293 words in the Architecture Assignment Document.
However, I also wrote 57 words for the Keynote presentation associated with the paper. Additionally, I proofread the entire document after all partners had finished writing their sections. During this process, I wrote another 100 words.
So, my total word count for this assignment is 1450 words.

- Ethan Gill: 1450 words
- Arthur Silveira:
- Ethan Smith: 950 words
- Matthew Turner: 400 words
