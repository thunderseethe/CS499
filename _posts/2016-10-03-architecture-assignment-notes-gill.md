This post refers to the Architecture Assignment, due on October 3rd. It also includes information about the associated presentation assignment.
During the course of these assignments, communication between the team was conducted primarily over Telegram, an instant messaging application. This allowed our team to work on the assignments at different times and maintain clear communication of responsibilities.

We decided to split up the Architecture document as follows:

- Matthew Turner: Architecture Diagram
- Ethan Smith and Arthur Silveira: Detailed Diagrams, Quality Assurance, and Metrics
- Ethan Gill (me): Testing Section, Title Page, Table of Contents

The testing section consists of 1217 words. Additionally, the Title Page and Table of Contents consist of 76 words. Thus, I wrote 1293 words in the Architecture Assignment Document.
However, I also wrote 57 words for the Keynote presentation associated with the paper. So, my total word count for this assignment is 1350 words.



You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
