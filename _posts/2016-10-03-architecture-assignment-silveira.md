This is the first post on my 'Developers Notebook' for the MagicMirror product our team is working on.

This first post regards the Architecture assignment due on Monday October 3rd.

This project was divided into sections and each team member worked on a section, collaboration  was done through iCloud Pages. And communication was done mostly through
the Telegram messaging application. Once all team members finished working on their individual sections we came together to do a quality assurance review of the document and work on the presentation for out project.

I feel that our method has proven very productive for this project and we continue to make good progress towards our overall end goal.
