I contributed to the architecture assignment by handling the architecture diagram in the form of a UML package diagram.  I separated out what I considered to be the large parts of our program and made them layers.  Within those layers, I further divided down into "packages".  I decided what the scope on examples of UML diagrams I'd found online as a resource.  Once I created the diagram, I made a small write-up about the diagram including what each layer does and the responsibility of each package.

After doing that, I filled in the presentation by adding content to each other the headers specified by the team.  I summarized a lot of the point from our architecture document and used the same graphics when applicable.
