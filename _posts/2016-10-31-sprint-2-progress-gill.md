During Sprint 2, our team didn't accomplish that much work. All of our project members had midterm exams, and other classwork took precedence over this project.

However, we did successfully create a new module, 'google_calendar'. For now, the module simply displays "Hello World" and does not perform any calendar fetching or parsing.

During Sprint 3, we plan to build Google Calendar functionality into this module, and then combine it with the original calendar module.
