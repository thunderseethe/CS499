During Sprint 1, our team accomplished the following:
We downloaded node.js sample code from Google for the Google Calendar API. We successfully configured a project on the Google Developer Console. (We named this Project "MagicMirror Google Calendar Bridge".) Once this Developer Console project was created, we used the Client ID and Client Secret from the project with the sample code. We successfully generated a user token for each of our user accounts.

Using the generated Client ID, Client Secret, and User Token, we successfully downloaded JSON data containing information from the user's specified calendars. Once this information completed downloading, we logged it to the console.

As of now, we are ahead of schedule for this project. I feel that we can get this project completed successfully by the due date.
