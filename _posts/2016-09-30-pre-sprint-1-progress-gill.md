During the week of September 26th, our team accomplished a few of our project goals.
First, we each configured our personal development environments. This involved installing node.js on each of our machines. We then cloned the MagicMirror repository from GitHub. Finally, we verified correct behavior of the MagicMirror project out of the box by installing the electron module for node.js and running MagicMirror with default configuration settings.

Ethan Smith, Arthur, and I used macOS for this task, and were able to get our environments running relatively quickly. As Matthew Turner used a Chromebook, the task proved more difficult; he was able to accomplish it by viewing the MagicMirror output in a web browser instead of using electron.

I'm excited to begin development on this project in the coming weeks, starting with Sprint 1.
